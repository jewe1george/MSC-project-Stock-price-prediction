Topic: Stock Market Prediction Using Istanbul Stock Exchange

Purpose: The purpose of this code and project is to understand different techniques and knowledge of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques which can be applied on financial stock market data which involves different features and variables through literature of previous scholars and researchers and from online sources as well incorporating the concepts learned throughout the course work and the new techniques and methods learned during the knowledge gaining about the practical.

The code has the purpose to explain the different information it holds through the help of visualisations and correlations as well as implementation of Machine Learning models to learn on the patterns and trends the data has and to use those patterns and trends to predict for further ahead in time with accuracy.
